### Intro to ML class- Computer Assignment 03 Decision Tree Calssifier Model

_Brief description:_ 
A decision tree classifier model is developed to predict income class using a dataset containing 7 demographic variables. The model is trained, tested, and evaluated for performance. Hyperparameters are optimized through 4 runs to construct the "BEST" tree based on accuracy, followed by visualization and prediction of income for new instance.

_Code explanation:_ 

_Software:_ 
Python 3.x

_Data set:_ 
The dataset is obtained from the Census Bureau and represents salaries of people along with seven demographic variables. Target classes- 2 ('>50K' and '<=50k') [labels:1,0]. 48,842 rows. The path for the data source: "https://github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-03-Decision-Trees/blob/master/census_data.csv?raw=true".


_Instructions:_ 
Download the code file and run all in order. The Jupyter Notebook contains the entire code and logic for the decision tree classifier, as well as answers for the questions. Before running the program make sure you download the required package and import the needed libraries.
